# Syntax for variable naming in python
#the name of a variable should not start with a number(1space or 2p)
#the name of the variable should not start with any symbol(#,@)
#dont leave spaces with compound variable names or names with more than one word(in such case use _pay_use or use camelcase eg payAsYou )
# use relatable variable names or words(eg salary_netincome_grossprofit)
# it is recommended to start a variable name with small letters
# any variable name it should have a value(salary=1000)
#try to use shorter variable names(e.g sal to mean salary, net to mean netpay)
